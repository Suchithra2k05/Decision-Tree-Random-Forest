# Decision-Tree-Random-Forest

🌳 Decision Tree vs Random Forest Classifier

This project compares the performance of a Decision Tree Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier using the Iris Dataset. It also demonstrates hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to find the best model configurations.

📌 About the Models

Decision Tree Classifier
A tree-structured model that splits data based on feature values.
Easy to interpret but can overfit on small datasets.
Works well for small to medium-sized datasets.

Random Forest Classifier
An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.
Reduces overfitting by averaging results from many trees.
Usually provides better accuracy and generalization.

🎯 Project Objectives

Load and explore the Iris dataset.
Train a Decision Tree model and tune parameters.
Train a Random Forest model and tune parameters.
Compare accuracy and classification reports.

📂 Workflow

Load Dataset
Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Split Data
70% training, 30% testing.
Train Decision Tree
Tune max_depth and min_samples_split.
Train Random Forest
Tune n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split.
Evaluate Models
Compare accuracy scores and classification reports.
